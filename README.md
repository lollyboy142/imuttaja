This is a torrent it sucking tool called in finnish language "ip imuttaja" that means ip sucker. To collect the ip addresses the user should press the button that says...
"Valitse torrent tiedosto ja imuta" That means select torrent and suck. The imuttaja1 version windows executable fails to start because i could not get the libtorrent 
library to work even with the help of the ai. If someone could make it work then it would be great. 
Imuttaja2 should work in windows also.
